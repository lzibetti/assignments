Vschool exercise for preparation in coding the collossal rpg project. This game is finished, it uses to while loops that allow the game to be reused without restarting it. The hint file is to help with the project.

 your character needs to find the key in the room and then open the door.
 There's also a hole in the wall in the room. If your character puts his hand

 they can't open the door unless they find the key first
 they die if they put their hand in the hole.
