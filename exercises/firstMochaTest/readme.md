Introduction to unit testing using mocha, chai. Mocha needs to be installed only once. Chai has to be installed for each project that will use unit testing. Install chai in the project directory from the terminal with `npm i chai`. The structure of the project directory is by convention:
project name =>
    js directory -> contains the js app files
    test directory -> contains the unit tes files with describe and assert
    index.html
    styles.css
    nodes-module -> contains the files used by chai for test unit
