Given an array of strings, find the 3 adjacent elements with the longest combined length. Return them in the form of an array.

Example:

For inputArray = ["this", "is, "an", "array], the output of combined(inputArray) should return ["is", "an", "array"] because they have the longest combined length of any 3 adjacent elements.
